# Ray Tracer

This project is a work-through _in progress_ of **The Ray Tracer Challenge**, a book by Jamis Buck.

The Ray Tracer Challenge is "A Test-Driven Guide to Your First 3D Renderer".  Find out more at [raytracerchallenge.com](http://raytracerchallenge.com/).

The challenge can be completed in any language. I am using Java, with JUnit testing library.

## Who is Ray Tracer?
No one, probably. Just an assumption you make when you haven't heard of ray tracing before.

## What is ray tracing?
Ray tracing is a 3D computer graphics rendering technique, for image generation. You use pixels to 'trace' the path of light and the way that light interacts with virtual objects. The technique can be used to create hyper realistic images (or not). However, the more detailed your traced images, the more computational power you consume.
